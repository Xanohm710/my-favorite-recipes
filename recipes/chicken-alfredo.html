    <p>Chicken alfredo is a classic favorite—a creamy white sauce, long strands of pasta mixed with tender pieces of lean protein. For this recipe, I cut the meat for quicker cooking and use a generous amount of seasonings for maximum flavor.</p>
    <p>If you’re looking for a delicious gourmet Italian dinner, you’re in the right place! My Italian husband Jason loves his pasta dishes, so when I serve up a plate of chicken alfredo, it always puts a big smile on his face. I get it. There are so many wonderful flavors and textures that come together that it’s hard to resist.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1lb boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
      <li>3 teaspoons kosher salt, divided</li>
      <li>¾ teaspoon black pepper, divided</li>
      <li>¼ teaspoon paprika, sweet</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>3 quarts water</li>
      <li>8 ounces fettuccine</li>
      <li>2 teaspoons minced garlic</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>1 ½ cup heavy cream</li>
      <li>1 cup grated parmesan cheese, or parmigiano reggiano</li>
      <li>⅛ teaspoon nutmeg</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon chopped parsley</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>

    <h4><b>Chicken</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Cut each chicken breast in half lengthwise to create two cutlets, four total.</li>
      <li>In a small bowl combine 1 teaspoon salt, ¼ teaspoon pepper, and paprika. Evenly season both sides of the chicken with the spice mixture.</li>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium heat. Once the pan is hot, add the olive oil. Add the chicken and cook until the surface is browned, about 5 for 6 minutes. Flip and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160 to 165ºF (71 to 74ºC), about 5 to 7 minutes.</li>
      <li>Transfer to a plate and cover with foil to keep warm. Wash and dry the pan to use for making the alfredo sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><b>Pasta</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>In a large pot, bring 3 quarts of water to a boil. Add 1 ½ teaspoon salt, stir to dissolve.</li>
      <li>Add the pasta and cook until al dente, about 10 to 12 minutes, or according to the manufacturer's directions. Use tongs to transfer to a colander—Reserve the starchy pasta water. While the pasta cooks, make the alfredo sauce.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><b>Alfredo Sauce</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Heat a large skillet over medium-low heat. Add butter. Once melted, add garlic and saute until fragrant, 30 to 60 seconds. Do not brown the butter or garlic.</li>
      <li>Add the heavy cream, ½ teaspoon salt, and ½ teaspoon pepper, stir to combine. Bring the cream to a simmer over medium heat. Cook, frequently stirring, scraping the sides and bottom of the pan to make sure the cream does not curdle.</li>
      <li>Reduce the sauce to about 1 cup, 10 to 12 minutes. It should be slightly thickened and be able to coat the back of a spoon.</li>
      <li>Turn off the heat and stir in the parmesan cheese and nutmeg. If the sauce is too thick, add water or cream. Add 1 tablespoon at a time until you reach the desired consistency—season with salt and pepper to taste.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4><b>To Serve</b></h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Add the pasta to the sauce, gently tossing to combine.</li>
      <li>Slice the chicken against the grain into ½-inch thick pieces.</li>
      <li>Divide the pasta among bowls, top with sliced chicken and chopped parsley.</li>
    </ol>
